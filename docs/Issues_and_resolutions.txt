Error 1 :
Spring Boot – Cannot determine embedded database driver class for database type NONE

Sol 1 : Exclude auto configuration of DataSource in the Spring Boot application class. We can do this using EnableAutoConfiguration annotation as shown in below code.

Sol 2 : Another way to fix this issue is to provide spring.datasource.url in the application.properties file. It worked for me, although I didn’t provided any database username and password.
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/Test_DB
